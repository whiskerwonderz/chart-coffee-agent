# Coffee Processing Methods

Processing is how coffee cherries are transformed into green (unroasted) coffee beans. The method significantly impacts flavor profile, body, and acidity.

## Overview of Processing

After harvesting, coffee cherries must be processed to extract the bean. The cherry has several layers:
1. **Outer skin** (exocarp)
2. **Fruit pulp** (mesocarp)
3. **Mucilage** (sticky pectin layer)
4. **Parchment** (endocarp)
5. **Silver skin** (seed coat)
6. **Bean** (seed/endosperm)

## Washed (Wet) Process

The most common method for high-quality specialty coffee.

### Process Steps
1. **Harvesting**: Pick ripe cherries only
2. **Depulping**: Remove outer skin and pulp mechanically
3. **Fermentation**: 12-72 hours in water tanks
4. **Washing**: Remove remaining mucilage
5. **Drying**: Sun-dried on patios/raised beds or mechanical dryers
6. **Resting**: 30-60 days in parchment
7. **Milling**: Remove parchment before export

### Fermentation Details
| Type | Duration | Result |
|------|----------|--------|
| Wet fermentation | 12-36 hours | Clean, bright |
| Dry fermentation | 12-24 hours | More body |
| Extended | 36-72 hours | Complex, risky |

### Flavor Profile
- **Clean cup**: Clear, transparent flavors
- **Bright acidity**: Crisp, vibrant
- **Lighter body**: Tea-like to medium
- **Clarity**: Origin character shines through
- **Common descriptors**: Citrus, floral, tea-like, crisp

### Best For
- Highlighting terroir
- Complex, delicate coffees
- High-altitude origins
- Light to medium roasts

### Producing Regions
- Colombia, Kenya, Ethiopia (washed lots)
- Central America (Guatemala, Costa Rica)
- East Africa (Rwanda, Burundi)

## Natural (Dry) Process

The oldest method, where whole cherries dry with fruit intact.

### Process Steps
1. **Harvesting**: Select ripe cherries
2. **Sorting**: Remove defects and unripes
3. **Drying**: Spread whole cherries on patios/raised beds
4. **Turning**: Rake regularly to prevent mold (3-6 weeks)
5. **Hulling**: Remove dried fruit and parchment
6. **Resting**: 30-60 days minimum

### Drying Requirements
- 10-12% moisture target
- 2-4 weeks typical duration
- Regular turning essential
- Protection from rain/dew
- Airflow critical

### Flavor Profile
- **Heavy body**: Syrupy, full
- **Low acidity**: Soft, rounded
- **Fruity**: Berry, tropical fruit
- **Fermented notes**: Wine-like, boozy
- **Sweetness**: Intense, sugar-cane
- **Common descriptors**: Blueberry, strawberry, wine, tropical

### Best For
- Fruit-forward profiles
- Full-bodied espresso
- Lower-altitude regions
- Water-scarce areas

### Producing Regions
- Ethiopia (Sidama, Guji)
- Brazil (major producer)
- Yemen
- Indonesia (Sumatra)

### Risks
- Inconsistency if poorly managed
- Mold and over-fermentation
- Defects (ferment, phenol)

## Honey Process

A hybrid method leaving some mucilage on during drying.

### Process Steps
1. **Depulping**: Remove skin, leave mucilage
2. **Drying**: Dry with mucilage attached
3. **Turning**: Less frequent than natural
4. **Hulling**: Remove dried mucilage and parchment

### Honey Variations

| Type | Mucilage % | Drying Time | Flavor |
|------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| White | 10-20% | 5-7 days | Clean, bright |
| Yellow | 25-50% | 8-12 days | Subtle sweetness |
| Red | 50-75% | 12-18 days | Fruity, honey |
| Black | 80-100% | 18-25 days | Intense, syrupy |

### Flavor Profile
- **Medium body**: Between washed and natural
- **Balanced sweetness**: Honey, caramel
- **Moderate acidity**: Softer than washed
- **Fruity but clean**: Less ferment than natural
- **Common descriptors**: Honey, brown sugar, stone fruit

### Best For
- Balanced, sweet profiles
- Specialty single origins
- Espresso blends
- Those new to specialty coffee

### Producing Regions
- Costa Rica (popularized method)
- El Salvador
- Brazil
- Guatemala

## Experimental Processing Methods

### Anaerobic Fermentation
Fermentation in oxygen-free sealed tanks.

**Process:**
1. Seal cherries/depulped beans in airtight containers
2. Ferment 24-96+ hours
3. CO2 builds up, creating unique environment
4. Results in intense, unusual flavors

**Flavor Profile:**
- Intense, tropical
- Wine-like, boozy
- Candy-like sweetness
- Unconventional descriptors

### Carbonic Maceration
Borrowed from winemaking.

**Process:**
1. Whole cherries in CO2-rich environment
2. Intracellular fermentation occurs
3. 24-100+ hours
4. Then processed as washed or natural

**Flavor Profile:**
- Bright, clean
- Tropical fruit
- Floral notes
- Effervescent quality

### Lactic Fermentation
Controlled lactobacillus fermentation.

**Process:**
1. Inoculate with specific bacteria
2. Extended fermentation (48-96 hours)
3. Controlled temperature and pH
4. Creates unique flavor compounds

**Flavor Profile:**
- Creamy body
- Yogurt-like notes
- Tropical fruit
- Complex acidity

### Koji/Yeast Fermentation
Using specific fungi or yeast strains.

**Process:**
1. Inoculate with selected organisms
2. Controlled fermentation
3. Specific flavor development
4. Precise environmental control

## Processing Impact Summary

| Method | Body | Acidity | Sweetness | Fruit | Clarity |
|--------|------|---------|-----------|-------|---------|
| Washed | Light-Med | High | Moderate | Clean | High |
| Natural | Heavy | Low | High | Intense | Low |
| Honey | Medium | Medium | High | Moderate | Medium |
| Anaerobic | Variable | Variable | High | Intense | Variable |

## Choosing Coffee by Processing

### For Espresso
- **Naturals**: Fruity, sweet shots
- **Honey**: Balanced, caramel notes
- **Washed**: Clean, bright (better for milk drinks)

### For Pour Over
- **Washed**: Clarity highlights origin
- **Light honey**: Subtle sweetness
- **Naturals**: Fruit-forward experience

### For Cold Brew
- **Naturals**: Enhances fruitiness
- **Honey**: Smooth, sweet
- **Washed**: Clean, refreshing

## Quality Indicators

### Well-Processed Coffee Signs
- Even color (green beans)
- No visible defects
- Clean, distinct flavors
- Appropriate moisture (10-12%)
- Consistent screen size

### Processing Defects

| Defect | Cause | Cup Impact |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Ferment | Over-fermentation | Vinegar, rotting |
| Mold | Improper drying | Musty, earthy |
| Stinker | Bacteria | Foul, rotten |
| Faded | Poor storage | Flat, papery |
| Phenolic | Chemical exposure | Chemical taste |

## Environmental Considerations

| Method | Water Use | Energy | Waste |
|--------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Washed | High | Moderate | Wastewater |
| Natural | None | Low (sun) | Minimal |
| Honey | Low | Low | Moderate |

**Sustainability Notes:**
- Natural process most eco-friendly
- Washed wastewater can pollute if untreated
- Mucilage can be composted or used for cascara
