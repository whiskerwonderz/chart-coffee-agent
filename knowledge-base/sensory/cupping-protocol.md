# SCA Cupping Protocol

Cupping is the standardized method for evaluating coffee quality used by professionals worldwide. This protocol is based on the Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) standards.

## Equipment Required

| Item | Specification |
|------|--------------|
| Cupping bowls | 180-220ml capacity, tempered glass or ceramic |
| Cupping spoons | Wide, deep bowl, stainless steel |
| Grinder | Burr grinder, cleaned between samples |
| Scale | 0.1g precision |
| Kettle | Temperature-controlled, gooseneck preferred |
| Timer | Countdown capability |
| Water | SCA standard (150 ppm TDS, pH 7.0) |
| Cupping forms | SCA standard or CVA forms |

## Sample Preparation

### Coffee-to-Water Ratio
- **Ratio**: 8.25g coffee per 150ml water
- **Alternative**: 55g/L (5.5g per 100ml)
- **Tolerance**: ±0.25g

### Grind Size
- Slightly coarser than drip/filter
- 70-75% passing through US Standard size 20 mesh sieve
- Grind immediately before cupping (within 15 minutes)

### Roast Level
- Light to medium (Agtron 58-63 whole bean, 63-68 ground)
- 8-24 hours rest after roasting
- No more than 24 hours since grinding

## Water Standards (SCA)

| Parameter | Target | Acceptable Range |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| TDS | 150 mg/L | 75-250 mg/L |
| Calcium Hardness | 68 mg/L | 17-85 mg/L |
| Total Alkalinity | 40 mg/L | 40-70 mg/L |
| pH | 7.0 | 6.5-7.5 |
| Sodium | 10 mg/L | At or near 10 mg/L |
| Chlorine | 0 mg/L | 0 mg/L |

## Cupping Procedure

### Step 1: Dry Fragrance (0:00)
1. Place ground coffee in cupping bowl
2. Shake bowl gently to settle grounds
3. Evaluate dry fragrance by sniffing
4. Note initial impressions

### Step 2: Add Water (0:00-0:15)
1. Heat water to 93°C (200°F)
2. Pour water directly onto grounds
3. Fill to rim of bowl
4. Ensure all grounds are saturated
5. Start timer

### Step 3: Wet Aroma - Crust (0:00-4:00)
1. Allow crust to form undisturbed
2. At 3-4 minutes, evaluate wet aroma
3. Position nose close to crust before breaking

### Step 4: Break the Crust (4:00)
1. Use cupping spoon to break crust
2. Push grounds from front to back 3 times
3. Bring nose close while breaking
4. Evaluate aroma released
5. Clear foam and floating grounds

### Step 5: Tasting (8:00-15:00+)
1. Wait until temperature reaches ~70°C (160°F)
2. Slurp coffee forcefully from spoon
3. Aspirate to spray across palate
4. Evaluate all attributes
5. Spit into spittoon
6. Rinse spoon between samples

### Step 6: Cool Down Evaluation
1. Continue tasting as coffee cools
2. Note how flavors develop
3. Final evaluation at room temperature
4. Acidity and sweetness often more apparent when cooler

## Scoring Attributes

### Traditional SCA Cupping Form (100-point scale)

| Attribute | Max Score | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Fragrance/Aroma | 10 | Dry and wet aromatic aspects |
| Flavor | 10 | Main character, mid-palate |
| Aftertaste | 10 | Length and quality of finish |
| Acidity | 10 | Brightness, quality of acid |
| Body | 10 | Tactile mouthfeel, weight |
| Balance | 10 | Harmony of all elements |
| Uniformity | 10 | Consistency across cups (5 cups) |
| Clean Cup | 10 | Absence of defects (5 cups) |
| Sweetness | 10 | Presence of sweetness (5 cups) |
| Overall | 10 | Cupper's holistic assessment |
| **Subtotal** | **100** | |
| Defects | -2 to -4 per defect | Subtract from total |
| **Final Score** | **Variable** | Subtotal minus defects |

### Quality Classification

| Score Range | Classification |
|-------------|---------------|
| 90-100 | Outstanding - Specialty |
| 85-89.99 | Excellent - Specialty |
| 80-84.99 | Very Good - Specialty |
| Below 80 | Below Specialty Quality |

## Attribute Definitions

### Fragrance/Aroma
- **Fragrance**: Smell of dry ground coffee
- **Aroma**: Smell of wet coffee (after water added)
- Evaluate intensity and quality

### Flavor
- Combined impression of taste and aroma
- Experienced from first sip through swallowing/spitting
- Main character of the coffee

### Aftertaste
- Length of positive flavor qualities
- Persistence after swallowing/spitting
- Can be short, medium, or long

### Acidity
- **Positive descriptors**: Bright, crisp, vibrant, lively
- **Negative descriptors**: Sour, astringent, sharp
- High-quality acidity adds to overall experience

### Body
- Physical mouthfeel and texture
- Light, medium, or heavy
- Descriptions: watery, tea-like, silky, syrupy, creamy

### Balance
- How well components work together
- No single attribute overwhelming others
- Harmony of flavor, acidity, body, aftertaste

### Uniformity (5 cups)
- Consistency between cups
- 2 points per consistent cup
- Deduct for cups that differ

### Clean Cup (5 cups)
- Freedom from off-flavors
- 2 points per clean cup
- Deduct for any cup with defects

### Sweetness (5 cups)
- Presence of sweetness
- 2 points per sweet cup
- Indicates good processing and ripeness

## Coffee Value Assessment (CVA) - New System

The SCA introduced the Coffee Value Assessment in 2024 as an evolved approach:

### Key Changes from Traditional Cupping
1. Separates descriptive and affective assessment
2. Uses 9-point scale instead of 10-point
3. Focuses on value proposition
4. Includes extrinsic factors (intended use, buyer needs)

### CVA Attributes
- Physical integrity
- Flavor quality
- Uniformity
- Purpose alignment
- Descriptive attributes (using SCA Flavor Wheel)

## Common Defects

| Defect | Cause | Cup Impact |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Rio/Rioy | Bacterial infection | Medicinal, iodine |
| Ferment | Over-fermentation | Vinegar, rotting fruit |
| Stinker | Fungal infection | Foul, rotten |
| Earthy | Drying on ground | Musty, dirt-like |
| Phenolic | Chemical contamination | Chemical, hospital |
| Baggy | Poor storage | Cardboard, stale |
| Potato | Bacteria (E. Africa) | Raw potato |

## Best Practices

### Before Cupping
- Clean palate (water, unsalted crackers)
- Avoid strong flavors 30 minutes prior
- No perfume or scented products
- Consistent lighting and environment

### During Cupping
- Cup blind when evaluating for quality
- Taste each sample multiple times
- Allow coffee to cool for full evaluation
- Reset palate between samples

### Calibration
- Regular calibration sessions with team
- Use reference samples
- Discuss and align on descriptors
- Track and review scoring patterns
