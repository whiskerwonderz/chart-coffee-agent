# French Press Brewing Guide

The French Press (also called cafetière or press pot) is a full-immersion brewing method that produces a rich, full-bodied coffee with oils and fine particles intact.

## Overview

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Method Type** | Full immersion |
| **Brew Time** | 4-5 minutes |
| **Grind Size** | Coarse |
| **Coffee:Water Ratio** | 1:15 to 1:17 |
| **Water Temperature** | 93-96°C (199-205°F) |
| **Difficulty** | Easy |
| **Body** | Heavy, full |
| **Clarity** | Low (unfiltered) |

## Why French Press?

## Standard Recipe

### Basic Parameters

| Parameter | Standard | Range |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Coffee | 30g | 25-35g |
| Water | 500g | 400-600g |
| Ratio | 1:16.7 | 1:15-1:17 |

### Step-by-Step Process

**Preparation:**
1. Boil water, let cool to 94°C
2. Preheat French Press with hot water
3. Grind 30g coffee coarse (sea salt texture)
4. Discard preheat water

**Brewing:**
1. Add ground coffee to press
2. Start timer
3. Pour 500g water evenly over grounds
4. Let bloom undisturbed for 30 seconds
5. Stir gently at 0:30
6. Place lid on (don't plunge yet)
7. Wait until 4:00 total
8. Press slowly and steadily
9. Serve immediately

## James Hoffmann's French Press Technique

A refined method for cleaner cups:

### The Method

1. **Grind**: Medium-fine (finer than traditional)
2. **Add coffee**: 30g to press
3. **Add water**: 500g at 94°C, start timer
4. **Wait**: 4:00 total, don't touch
5. **At 4:00**: Skim floating crust and foam off top
6. **Wait more**: Additional 5-8 minutes
7. **Press**: Very gently, just below surface
8. **Pour**: Slowly to avoid disturbing sediment

### Why This Works
- Finer grind increases extraction
- Extended time allows sediment to settle
- Skimming removes bitterness
- Gentle press avoids agitation
- Result: Cleaner cup with full body

### Comparison

| Aspect | Traditional | Hoffmann Method |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Grind | Coarse | Medium-fine |
| Total time | 4 min | 9-12 min |
| Agitation | Stir at start | None |
| Plunge | Full depth | Just below surface |
| Clarity | Low | Medium |

## Grind Size Guide

### The Right Grind

**Target**: Coarse, similar to sea salt

| Too Fine | Just Right | Too Coarse |
|----------|------------|------------|
| Muddy cup | Clean but full | Weak, watery |
| Hard to press | Easy plunge | Fast plunge |
| Over-extracted | Balanced | Under-extracted |
| Bitter | Sweet | Sour |

### Grinder Settings (Approximate)
- Baratza Encore: 28-32
- Comandante: 28-32 clicks
- 1Zpresso JX: 3+ rotations
- Fellow Ode: 5-7

## Water Temperature

### Temperature Guidelines

| Temperature | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| 96°C+ | Risks over-extraction |
| 93-96°C | Optimal range |
| 90-93°C | Slightly under-extracted |
| <90°C | Sour, under-extracted |

### Practical Tips
- Boil and wait 30-60 seconds
- Or use variable temp kettle
- Cold ambient temp = preheat press
- Check with thermometer initially

## Troubleshooting

### Sour Coffee
| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Under-extracted | Grind finer |
| Short brew time | Extend to 4-5 min |
| Water too cool | Increase temperature |
| Ratio too dilute | Use more coffee |

### Bitter Coffee
| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Over-extracted | Grind coarser |
| Too long steep | Reduce time |
| Water too hot | Lower temperature |
| Too much coffee | Reduce dose |

### Muddy/Silty Cup
| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Grind too fine | Coarsen significantly |
| Cheap grinder | Upgrade or sift fines |
| Pressing too hard | Gentle, slow press |
| Pouring dregs | Leave last 10% in press |

### Weak Coffee
| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Not enough coffee | Increase dose |
| Grind too coarse | Fine up slightly |
| Short steep time | Extend brew time |

### Hard to Press
| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Grind too fine | Much coarser grind |
| Mesh clogged | Clean filter thoroughly |
| Too much coffee | Reduce dose |

## Cleaning & Maintenance

### After Each Use
1. Discard grounds (compost, not sink)
2. Rinse carafe and plunger
3. Wash with mild soap if needed
4. Let air dry

### Deep Cleaning (Weekly)
1. Disassemble plunger completely
2. Clean all mesh and components
3. Remove coffee oil buildup
4. Reassemble ensuring tight fit

### Maintenance Tips
- Replace mesh if damaged
- Check seal on plunger
- Inspect glass for cracks
- Don't put in dishwasher (glass types)

## Coffee Selection

### Best Coffees for French Press

**Ideal Characteristics:**
- Medium to dark roast
- Full-bodied origins
- Chocolate/nut profiles
- Lower acidity

**Great Origins:**
- Brazil (chocolate, nuts)
- Sumatra (earthy, full)
- Guatemala (balanced)
- Colombia (caramel, mild)

**Less Ideal:**
- Very light roasts (lack body)
- Highly acidic coffees (Kenyan AA)
- Delicate, tea-like coffees

### Roast Level Impact

| Roast | French Press Result |
|-------|---------------------|
| Light | Bright but thin |
| Medium | Balanced, sweet |
| Medium-Dark | Rich, chocolatey |
| Dark | Bold, can be bitter |

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Grind too fine**: Creates muddy, bitter coffee
2. **Water too hot**: Causes over-extraction
3. **Leaving coffee in press**: Continues extracting
4. **Pressing too hard**: Pushes fines through
5. **Not preheating**: Temperature drops too fast
6. **Stale coffee**: Flat, papery flavors
7. **Inconsistent ratio**: Unpredictable results

## French Press vs Other Methods

| Aspect | French Press | Pour Over | AeroPress |
|--------|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| Body | Heavy | Light-Medium | Medium |
| Clarity | Low | High | High |
| Oils | Preserved | Filtered | Mostly filtered |
| Sediment | Some | None | None |
| Time | 4-5 min | 2.5-3.5 min | 1-2 min |
| Skill | Easy | Moderate | Easy |
| Cleanup | Moderate | Easy | Easy |

---

## Pro Tips

1. **Decant immediately**: Don't leave coffee in press after plunging
2. **Pour slowly**: Avoid disturbing settled sediment
3. **Leave the last bit**: Final pour has most sediment
4. **Use fresh coffee**: French press amplifies staleness
5. **Experiment with time**: 4-5 min for standard, 8-12 min for Hoffmann method
6. **Try cupping spoons**: Skim off fines before plunging
