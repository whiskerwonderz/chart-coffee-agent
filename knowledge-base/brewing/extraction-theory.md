# Coffee Extraction Theory

Extraction is the process of dissolving soluble compounds from coffee grounds into water. Understanding extraction is fundamental to brewing great coffee.

## What is Extraction?

Coffee beans contain approximately 30% soluble compounds. During brewing, water dissolves these compounds to create the beverage we drink.

### Soluble Compounds in Coffee

| Compound Type | Percentage | Flavor Contribution |
|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| Sugars | ~8% | Sweetness |
| Organic acids | ~8% | Brightness, sourness |
| Lipids | ~13% | Body, mouthfeel |
| Proteins | ~10% | Body, crema |
| Caffeine | ~1.5% | Bitterness |
| Chlorogenic acids | ~7% | Bitterness, astringency |
| Melanoidins | Variable | Color, body, bitterness |

## Extraction Percentage

### Target Range
- **Ideal extraction**: 18-22%
- **Under-extracted**: Below 18%
- **Over-extracted**: Above 22%

### Calculating Extraction
```
Extraction % = (TDS × Beverage Weight) / Coffee Dose × 100
```

Example:
- Coffee dose: 18g
- Beverage weight: 36g
- TDS: 10%
- Extraction = (0.10 × 36) / 18 × 100 = 20%

## Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)

TDS measures the concentration of dissolved coffee in water.

### Ideal TDS by Brew Method

| Method | Target TDS |
|--------|-----------|
| Filter/Pour Over | 1.2-1.5% |
| French Press | 1.2-1.5% |
| AeroPress | 1.3-1.6% |
| Espresso | 8-12% |
| Cold Brew Concentrate | 3-5% |

### Measuring TDS
- Use a refractometer (digital preferred)
- Calibrate with distilled water
- Allow sample to cool to room temperature
- Take multiple readings for accuracy

## The Coffee Brewing Control Chart

Developed by the SCA, this chart maps the relationship between extraction and strength:

```
         Weak    Ideal    Strong
         |         |         |
Over  ---|---------|---------|--- Bitter, harsh
         |         |         |
Ideal ---|----[TARGET]-------|--- Balanced
         |         |         |
Under ---|---------|---------|--- Sour, thin
```

### Zones
- **Under-extracted + Weak**: Sour, thin, lacking flavor
- **Under-extracted + Strong**: Sour, intense, unpleasant
- **Over-extracted + Weak**: Bitter, thin, astringent
- **Over-extracted + Strong**: Bitter, harsh, undrinkable
- **Ideal Extraction + Ideal Strength**: Sweet, balanced, complex

## Extraction Order

Compounds dissolve at different rates:

### First to Extract (0-15 seconds)
1. Acids (fruity, sour notes)
2. Some sugars
3. Lighter aromatics
4. Caffeine

### Middle Extraction (15-25 seconds)
1. Sugars (sweetness)
2. Complex carbohydrates
3. Maillard compounds (caramel, chocolate)
4. Balance development

### Last to Extract (25+ seconds)
1. Bitter compounds
2. Tannins (astringency)
3. Heavy melanoidins
4. Woody, ashy notes

## Variables Affecting Extraction

### 1. Grind Size
| Grind | Surface Area | Extraction Speed |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| Fine | High | Fast |
| Medium | Moderate | Moderate |
| Coarse | Low | Slow |

**Key principle**: Finer grind = more surface area = faster extraction

### 2. Water Temperature
| Temperature | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| 85-90°C | Under-extracts, sour |
| 90-96°C | Ideal range |
| 96-100°C | Risk of over-extraction |

**Optimal**: 92-96°C (197-205°F) for most methods

### 3. Brew Time
- Longer time = more extraction
- Each method has optimal time range
- Diminishing returns after optimal point

### 4. Coffee-to-Water Ratio
| Ratio | Result |
|-------|--------|
| 1:15 | Stronger concentration |
| 1:16-1:17 | Standard/balanced |
| 1:18 | Lighter concentration |

### 5. Agitation
- Stirring or turbulence increases extraction
- More contact between water and grounds
- Can cause uneven extraction if overdone

### 6. Water Quality
- Minerals aid extraction
- Ideal TDS: 75-250 mg/L
- Too soft = under-extraction
- Too hard = over-extraction, scale buildup

## Troubleshooting Extraction

### Under-Extracted Coffee
**Symptoms**: Sour, sharp, lacking sweetness, thin body, quick finish

**Solutions**:
1. Grind finer
2. Increase brew time
3. Raise water temperature
4. Increase agitation
5. Check water isn't too soft

### Over-Extracted Coffee
**Symptoms**: Bitter, harsh, astringent, dry aftertaste, unpleasant intensity

**Solutions**:
1. Grind coarser
2. Decrease brew time
3. Lower water temperature
4. Reduce agitation
5. Check water isn't too hard

### The 1-Variable Rule
When dialing in, change only one variable at a time:
1. Make a change
2. Taste the result
3. Evaluate improvement
4. Adjust further or try different variable

## Extraction by Brew Method

### Pour Over (V60, Chemex)
- Target extraction: 18-22%
- Target TDS: 1.2-1.5%
- Ratio: 1:15 to 1:17
- Time: 2:30-4:00

### Espresso
- Target extraction: 18-22%
- Target TDS: 8-12%
- Ratio: 1:2 to 1:2.5
- Time: 25-35 seconds

### French Press
- Target extraction: 18-22%
- Target TDS: 1.2-1.5%
- Ratio: 1:15 to 1:17
- Time: 4:00 steep + 5:00 settle

### Cold Brew
- Target extraction: 18-22%
- Target TDS: 2-4% (concentrate)
- Ratio: 1:4 to 1:8 (concentrate)
- Time: 12-24 hours

## Advanced Concepts

### Evenness of Extraction
- Uniform particle size improves evenness
- Water distribution matters
- Pre-infusion/blooming helps saturation

### Channel Resistance (Espresso)
- Channels cause uneven extraction
- Water follows path of least resistance
- WDT (Weiss Distribution Technique) helps
- Proper tamping creates even puck

### Bypass Brewing
- Some water bypasses coffee bed
- Increases volume without extraction
- Used in batch brewing for dilution

## Tools for Measuring

| Tool | Measures | Cost |
|------|----------|------|
| Refractometer | TDS | $200-700 |
| Scale | Dose/yield | $20-200 |
| Thermometer | Temperature | $10-50 |
