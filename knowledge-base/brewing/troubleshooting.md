# Coffee Brewing Troubleshooting Guide

A comprehensive guide to diagnosing and fixing common coffee brewing problems across all methods.

## Quick Diagnosis Chart

| Taste | Likely Cause | Quick Fix |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| Sour | Under-extraction | Grind finer, longer time |
| Bitter | Over-extraction | Grind coarser, shorter time |
| Weak | Low concentration | More coffee, less water |
| Harsh | Over-extraction | Lower temp, coarser grind |
| Flat | Stale coffee | Use fresher beans |
| Muddy | Over-extracted, fines | Coarser grind, better filter |

## Sour Coffee

### Symptoms
- Sharp, acidic taste
- Lacks sweetness
- Thin body
- Short finish
- Lemony or vinegar-like

### Causes & Solutions

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Grind too coarse | Grind finer |
| Brew time too short | Extend extraction time |
| Water too cool | Increase temperature to 92-96°C |
| Ratio too dilute | Use more coffee |
| Under-agitation | Stir or increase turbulence |
| Coffee too fresh | Let beans rest 7-14 days post-roast |

### Method-Specific Fixes

**Espresso:**
- Grind finer (1-2 steps)
- Increase yield (e.g., 1:2 to 1:2.5)
- Raise temperature 1-2°C

**Pour Over:**
- Use finer grind
- Pour slower
- Increase water temperature
- Add more agitation/stirs

**French Press:**
- Extend steep time (4-5 min)
- Use finer grind
- Increase water temperature

## Bitter Coffee

### Symptoms
- Harsh, unpleasant taste
- Lingering bitterness
- Astringent/drying sensation
- Burnt or ashy notes
- Heavy, cloying finish

### Causes & Solutions

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Grind too fine | Grind coarser |
| Brew time too long | Shorten extraction |
| Water too hot | Lower temp to 90-94°C |
| Too much coffee | Reduce dose |
| Over-agitation | Stir less, pour gentler |
| Dark roast | Adjust expectations or switch beans |

### Method-Specific Fixes

**Espresso:**
- Grind coarser
- Reduce yield (e.g., 1:2.5 to 1:2)
- Lower temperature 1-2°C
- Reduce dose slightly

**Pour Over:**
- Use coarser grind
- Pour faster
- Reduce brew time
- Lower water temperature

**French Press:**
- Reduce steep time
- Use coarser grind
- Don't press too hard

- Unsatisfying

### Causes & Solutions

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Not enough coffee | Increase dose |
| Ratio too dilute | Use less water |

| Short brew time | Extend extraction |
| Stale coffee | Use fresher beans |

### Ideal Ratios by Method

| Method | Ratio | Coffee:Water |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Pour Over | 1:15-1:17 | 15g:250g |
| French Press | 1:15-1:17 | 30g:500g |
| AeroPress | 1:12-1:16 | 15g:200g |
| Espresso | 1:2-1:2.5 | 18g:36-45g |
| Cold Brew | 1:8-1:12 | 50g:500g |

## Muddy/Silty Coffee

### Symptoms
- Gritty texture
- Sediment in cup
- Heavy, unclean finish
- Cloudy appearance

### Causes & Solutions

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Grind too fine | Coarsen grind |
| Poor filter | Use better quality filter |
| Excessive fines | Sift grounds, upgrade grinder |
| French press mesh | Use finer mesh or decant carefully |

### Prevention Tips
- Invest in quality burr grinder
- Sift out fines with a sieve
- Rinse paper filters thoroughly
- Allow settling time before serving

---

## Channeling (Espresso)

### Symptoms
- Uneven extraction
- Spurting during extraction
- Blonde/dark spots in puck
- Inconsistent shot times
- Sour and bitter simultaneously

### Causes & Solutions

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Uneven distribution | Use WDT tool |
| Poor tamping | Level tamp, consistent pressure |
| Cracked puck | Handle portafilter gently |
| Stale/dry coffee | Use fresher beans |
| Worn gasket | Replace group gasket |

### Prevention Checklist
1. ✅ Even distribution before tamping
2. ✅ Level tamp with consistent pressure
3. ✅ No knocking after tamping
4. ✅ Lock portafilter gently
5. ✅ Check basket for damage

## Stale/Flat Coffee

### Symptoms
- Muted, dull flavors
- Lack of aroma
- Papery or cardboard notes
- No complexity
- Flat finish

### Causes & Solutions

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Old beans | Buy fresh, use within 4 weeks |
| Poor storage | Airtight container, cool and dark |
| Pre-ground coffee | Grind fresh before brewing |
| Freezer burn | Proper freezer storage technique |

### Optimal Freshness Timeline
| Stage | Days Post-Roast | Quality |
|-------|-----------------|---------|
| Degassing | 0-7 | Too fresh, CO2 interferes |
| Peak | 7-21 | Optimal flavor |
| Good | 21-35 | Still enjoyable |
| Declining | 35-60 | Noticeable fade |
| Stale | 60+ | Not recommended |

---

## Inconsistent Results

### Symptoms
- Variable taste cup to cup
- Unpredictable extraction times
- Different every brew

### Causes & Solutions

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Inconsistent dosing | Use scale every time |
| Variable grind | Clean/calibrate grinder |
| Water temperature flux | Use temp-stable kettle |
| Technique variation | Standardize your process |
| Beans from different bags | Buy from same lot |

### Keys to Consistency
1. **Weigh everything**: Dose, water, yield
2. **Time extraction**: Use a timer
3. **Control temperature**: Temp-stable equipment
4. **Document**: Keep a brew journal
5. **Single variable**: Change one thing at a time

## Specific Taste Defects

### Astringent/Dry
- **Cause**: Over-extraction, tannins
- **Fix**: Coarser grind, lower temp, shorter time

### Burnt/Ashy
- **Cause**: Dark roast, over-extraction
- **Fix**: Lower temp, shorter time, lighter roast

### Grassy/Green
- **Cause**: Under-roasted, under-extracted
- **Fix**: Better roast, finer grind, higher temp

### Fermented/Winey
- **Cause**: Bean defect or natural process
- **Fix**: Check bean quality, may be intentional

### Rubbery
- **Cause**: Robusta beans, defects
- **Fix**: Source better quality Arabica

### Metallic
- **Cause**: Equipment issue, water quality
- **Fix**: Clean equipment, filter water

### Cardboard/Papery
- **Cause**: Stale coffee, poor storage
- **Fix**: Fresh beans, proper storage

---

## Water Quality Issues

### Hard Water
- **Symptoms**: Scale buildup, flat taste, chalky
- **Fix**: Use filtered water, Third Wave Water

### Soft Water
- **Symptoms**: Under-extraction, sour, thin
- **Fix**: Add minerals, use balanced water

### Ideal Water Parameters
| Parameter | Target |

## Quick Reference: The 1-Variable Rule

When troubleshooting, change only ONE variable at a time:

1. **Identify** the problem (sour, bitter, weak, etc.)
2. **Choose** the most likely variable
3. **Adjust** in small increments
4. **Brew** and taste
5. **Evaluate** - better, worse, or same?
6. **Repeat** until resolved

### Adjustment Order (Pour Over)
1. Grind size (most impact)
2. Brew time
3. Water temperature
4. Ratio
5. Technique

### Adjustment Order (Espresso)
1. Grind size
2. Yield
3. Dose
4. Temperature
5. Pre-infusion
