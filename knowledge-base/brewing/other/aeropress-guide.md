## Two Brewing Methods

### Standard Method
Coffee on bottom, water added, flip to press.

**Pros:**
- Simpler, intuitive
- Faster for beginners
- Less risk of leaking

**Cons:**
- Coffee drips through during brew
- Less control over steep time
- Slightly uneven extraction

### Inverted Method
AeroPress upside down during brewing.

**Pros:**
- Full immersion, no drip-through
- Complete control of steep time
- Slightly higher extraction

**Cons:**
- Flip can be messy
- Risk of spills
- Requires practice

## James Hoffmann's Ultimate AeroPress Recipe

A refined technique from the 2023 methodology:

### Parameters

| Parameter | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Coffee | 11g |
| Water | 200g |
| Grind | Fine-medium |
| Temp | Boiling (100°C) |
| Time | ~3:30 |

### Method

1. **Setup**: Standard orientation, paper filter in cap, don't rinse
2. **Add coffee**: 11g fine-medium grind
3. **Add water**: 200g just off boil
4. **Insert plunger**: Just to create seal, don't press
5. **Wait**: 2:00 steep
6. **At 2:00**: Swirl gently 3 times
7. **Wait**: 30 seconds for grounds to settle
8. **Press**: Very gentle, 30+ seconds
9. **Stop**: Just before hissing

### Why This Works
- Lower dose = less waste, clear cup
- Boiling water = better extraction
- Long steep + swirl = even extraction
- Gentle press = no fines pushed through

## Troubleshooting

### Sour Coffee
| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Under-extracted | Grind finer |

| Steep too short | Extend time |
| Coffee too fresh | Let beans rest |

### Bitter Coffee
| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Over-extracted | Grind coarser |
| Water too hot | Reduce temperature |
| Steep too long | Shorten time |
| Pressing too hard | Gentle, slow press |

### Weak/Watery
| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Not enough coffee | Increase dose |
| Grind too coarse | Grind finer |
| Ratio too dilute | Less water |

### Muddy Cup
| Cause | Solution |

## Pro Tips

1. **Don't skip the bloom**: 30s with small water amount
2. **Experiment with temperature**: Lower temps for light roasts
3. **Bypass method**: Brew concentrated, dilute after
4. **Multiple filters**: Try 2 paper filters for extra clarity
5. **Pre-wet filter**: Removes paper taste
6. **Gentle pressing**: Slow = better extraction
7. **Timer is essential**: Consistency requires timing
