# Water Chemistry for Coffee

Water makes up 98-99% of brewed coffee, making it one of the most important and often overlooked variables in coffee quality.

## Why Water Matters

### Impact on Extraction
- Minerals facilitate extraction
- Different minerals extract different compounds
- pH affects perceived acidity
- Hardness impacts body and mouthfeel

### The Basics
- Water is a solvent for coffee compounds
- Pure H2O extracts poorly
- Some mineral content is essential
- Too many minerals cause problems

## Key Water Parameters

### Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)

| Range | Description | Coffee Impact |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| 0-50 mg/L | Very soft | Under-extraction, flat |
| 50-150 mg/L | Ideal range | Balanced extraction |
| 150-250 mg/L | Acceptable | Full, may lack clarity |
| 250+ mg/L | Hard | Scale risk, muted flavors |

**SCA Target**: 150 mg/L (acceptable range: 75-250 mg/L)

### Calcium Hardness

| Range | Description | Effect |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 0-30 mg/L | Soft | Poor extraction |
| 30-80 mg/L | Ideal | Balanced, sweet |
| 80-150 mg/L | Moderate | Fuller body |
| 150+ mg/L | Hard | Chalky, scale buildup |

**SCA Target**: 50-175 mg/L CaCO3

### Magnesium

| Level | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Low | Less extraction efficiency |
| Moderate (5-30 mg/L) | Enhances sweetness, brightness |
| High | Can taste bitter |

**Note**: Magnesium extracts more efficiently than calcium.

### Alkalinity (Buffering Capacity)

| Range | Description | Effect |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 0-20 mg/L | Very low | Bright, potentially sour |
| 20-50 mg/L | Ideal | Balanced acidity |
| 50-100 mg/L | Moderate | Muted acidity |
| 100+ mg/L | High | Flat, dull coffee |

**SCA Target**: 40 mg/L (acceptable: 40-70 mg/L)

### pH Level

| pH | Description | Effect |
|----|-------------|--------|
| 6.0-6.5 | Slightly acidic | Brighter cup |
| 6.5-7.0 | Neutral | Balanced |
| 7.0-7.5 | Slightly alkaline | Flatter cup |
| 7.5+ | Alkaline | Dull, chalky |

**SCA Target**: 7.0 (acceptable: 6.5-7.5)

## SCA Water Quality Standards

### Recommended Specifications

| Parameter | Target | Acceptable Range |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| TDS | 150 mg/L | 75-250 mg/L |
| Calcium Hardness | 68 mg/L | 17-85 mg/L |
| Total Alkalinity | 40 mg/L | At or near 40 mg/L |
| pH | 7.0 | 6.5-7.5 |
| Sodium | 10 mg/L | At or near 10 mg/L |
| Chlorine | 0 mg/L | 0 mg/L |
| Iron | 0 mg/L | 0 mg/L |

### Absolute Requirements
- **Chlorine**: Must be 0 (affects taste, damages equipment)
- **Iron**: Must be 0 (metallic taste, staining)
- **Odor**: Clean, fresh, no detectable odor

## Types of Water

### Tap Water
- Variable quality by location
- May contain chlorine
- Mineral content varies widely
- Filter at minimum

**Issues:**
- Chlorine/chloramine
- Variable hardness
- Potential contaminants
- Seasonal variation

### Filtered Water
- Carbon filter removes chlorine, odor
- Does NOT change mineral content
- Good baseline for most locations
- Requires regular filter changes

### Reverse Osmosis (RO)
- Removes nearly all minerals
- Very low TDS (~10-30 mg/L)
- **Must remineralize** for coffee
- Clean slate for custom water

### Distilled Water
- Pure H2O, no minerals
- Extracts poorly (flat, sour)
- **Never use pure distilled**
- Base for mineral recipes

### Bottled Water
- Consistent, labeled content
- Some brands ideal for coffee
- Expensive for regular use
- Check mineral content

## Bottled Water for Coffee

### Good Choices (approximate)

| Brand | TDS | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Crystal Geyser | 80-100 | Good for most brewing |
| Volvic | 130 | Balanced, available |
| Evian | 300+ | Too hard for coffee |
| Poland Spring | 50-60 | Slightly soft |
| Fiji | 200+ | High silica, harder |
| smartwater | 10-30 | Too soft alone |

### Hong Kong Context
- Tap water is generally soft (TDS ~50-80 mg/L)
- May need slight remineralization
- Watsons distilled: remineralize first
- Bonaqua: check label

## Creating Custom Water

### Third Wave Water
Pre-made mineral packets for coffee.

| Product | Best For | TDS |
|---------|----------|-----|
| Classic | All methods | ~150 |
| Espresso | Espresso machines | ~90 |
| Dark Roast | Darker coffees | ~120 |

**Usage**: Add one packet to 1 gallon distilled/RO water.

### DIY Mineral Concentrates

**Barista Hustle Recipe (Simple):**

**Concentrate A (Hardness):**
- 2.45g Epsom salt (MgSO4·7H2O)
- 500ml distilled water

**Concentrate B (Buffer):**
- 1.68g Baking soda (NaHCO3)
- 500ml distilled water

**To make 1L brewing water:**
- 40ml Concentrate A
- 10ml Concentrate B
- Fill to 1L with distilled/RO water

### Rao/Perger Water

| Ingredient | Amount | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Distilled water | 1L | Base |
| Magnesium sulfate | 0.119g | Mg hardness |
| Sodium bicarbonate | 0.084g | Alkalinity |

## Water for Different Brew Methods

### Espresso
- Lower TDS preferred (70-120 mg/L)
- Protects machine from scale
- Allows higher extraction
- Scale management critical

### Pour Over
- Moderate TDS (100-150 mg/L)
- Highlights acidity
- Clean, bright cups
- Standard SCA spec works well

### French Press/Immersion
- Slightly higher TDS acceptable (120-180 mg/L)
- Fuller body enhanced
- Less critical than pressure brewing

### Cold Brew
- Standard water fine
- Long contact time = high extraction
- Chlorine definitely removed
- Room temp more forgiving

## Troubleshooting Water Issues

### Signs of Water Problems

| Symptom | Likely Cause |
|---------|--------------|
| Flat, dull coffee | Too soft or high alkalinity |
| Sour, thin coffee | Very soft water |
| Chalky mouthfeel | Too hard (high calcium) |
| Metallic taste | Iron or copper |
| Chlorine smell | Inadequate filtration |
| Scale buildup | Hard water |

### Adjustments

**Coffee tastes flat:**
- Increase hardness
- Add magnesium
- Reduce alkalinity

**Coffee tastes harsh/bitter:**
- Reduce TDS
- Lower hardness
- Check alkalinity

**Coffee tastes sour/thin:**
- Add minerals
- Water too soft
- Increase hardness

## Equipment Protection

### Scale Prevention
- Use appropriate hardness (<100 mg/L for espresso)
- Regular descaling schedule
- Water softeners (ion exchange)
- Scale filters for machines

### Descaling Frequency

| Water Hardness | Descale Interval |
|----------------|------------------|
| Soft (<50 mg/L) | 6-12 months |
| Medium (50-150) | 3-6 months |
| Hard (150-250) | 1-3 months |
| Very hard (250+) | Monthly |

### Machine Water Requirements
- Check manufacturer specs
- Some require minimum hardness
- Most require maximum limits
- Warranty considerations

## Testing Your Water

### Simple Testing
- TDS meter (~$15-30)
- API test strips (aquarium supplies)
- Hardness test kits

### What to Test
1. TDS (most important)
2. pH
3. Hardness
4. Chlorine

### When to Test
- New water source
- Seasonal changes (tap water)
- Different brewing issues
- Before making adjustments

### Interpreting Results

| Your TDS | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 0-50 | Remineralize |
| 50-100 | May need slight boost |
| 100-200 | Likely good |
| 200-300 | Consider filtering |
| 300+ | Definitely filter/blend |

## Quick Reference

### Ideal Water Summary

| Parameter | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| TDS | 100-150 mg/L |
| Calcium | 40-70 mg/L |
| Magnesium | 10-30 mg/L |
| Alkalinity | 30-50 mg/L |
| pH | 6.5-7.5 |
| Chlorine | 0 |

### Simple Improvement Steps
1. **Minimum**: Filter tap water (carbon filter)
2. **Better**: Test and understand your water
3. **Best**: Create custom water from RO/distilled

---

## Pro Tips

1. **Start with testing**: Know what you're working with
2. **Chlorine first**: Always remove chlorine
3. **Consistency matters**: Same water = consistent results
4. **Match to roast**: Lighter roasts need less buffer
5. **Machine protection**: Don't sacrifice equipment for flavor
6. **Document everything**: Track water specs with recipes
