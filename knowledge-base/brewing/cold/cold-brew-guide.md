## Step-by-Step Method

### Immersion Method (Most Common)

**Preparation:**
1. Grind coffee extra coarse (coarser than French press)
2. Use filtered water at room temperature
3. Combine coffee and water in container

**Brewing:**
1. Stir to ensure all grounds are saturated
2. Cover loosely
3. Steep at room temperature or refrigerator
4. Room temp: 12-18 hours
5. Refrigerator: 18-24 hours

**Filtering:**
1. Remove grounds with coarse strainer
2. Filter through fine mesh
3. Optional: paper filter for extra clarity
4. Transfer to storage container

**Storage:**
- Refrigerate immediately
- Use within 2 weeks (concentrate)
- Use within 1 week (ready-to-drink)

## Variables & Adjustments

### Grind Size

| Grind | Result | Time Adjustment |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| Extra coarse | Cleaner, lighter | 18-24 hours |
| Coarse | Balanced | 14-18 hours |
| Medium-coarse | Richer, risk of bitter | 12-14 hours |

### Time

| Duration | Flavor | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| 12 hours | Lighter, tea-like | Under-extracted risk |
| 16 hours | Balanced | Sweet spot for most |
| 20 hours | Rich, full | Best for concentrate |
| 24+ hours | Heavy, bitter risk | Over-extraction possible |

### Temperature

| Environment | Time | Flavor |
|-------------|------|--------|
| Room temp (20-24°C) | 12-16 hours | Fuller, faster |
| Refrigerator (4°C) | 18-24 hours | Cleaner, slower |
| Mixed (start room, finish cold) | 12+6 hours | Balanced approach |

### Ratio Guide

| Ratio | Strength | Use |
|-------|----------|-----|
| 1:5 | Very strong concentrate | Cocktails, espresso-style |
| 1:8 | Strong concentrate | Dilute 1:1 or more |
| 1:10 | Medium concentrate | Light dilution |
| 1:12-15 | Ready to drink | No dilution |

## Serving Cold Brew

### Classic Iced Cold Brew
- Fill glass with ice
- Pour cold brew concentrate
- Add cold water or milk to taste
- Ratio: 1 part concentrate to 1-2 parts dilution

### Cold Brew with Milk
- Ice in glass
- Cold brew concentrate
- Milk (whole, oat, almond)
- Optional: simple syrup or vanilla

### Hot Cold Brew
- Heat cold brew concentrate
- Dilute with hot water
- Smooth, low-acid hot coffee
- Works surprisingly well

### Nitro Cold Brew
- Cold brew in keg
- Charged with nitrogen
- Creates creamy, Guinness-like pour
- Naturally sweet, no sugar needed

### Cold Brew Cocktails
- Espresso martini (with vodka, Kahlua)
- Cold brew tonic (with tonic water)
- Cold brew with whiskey
- Coffee negroni

## Coffee Selection

### Best Coffees for Cold Brew

**Ideal Characteristics:**
- Medium to dark roast
- Chocolate, caramel, nutty profiles
- Lower acidity origins
- Full-bodied coffees

**Great Origins:**
- Brazil (chocolate, nuts, smooth)
- Colombia (caramel, balanced)
- Sumatra (earthy, full body)

## Troubleshooting

### Weak/Watery
| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Ratio too dilute | Use more coffee (1:8) |
| Under-extracted | Extend brew time |
| Grind too coarse | Slightly finer grind |

### Bitter/Harsh
| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Over-extracted | Reduce brew time |
| Grind too fine | Coarsen grind |
| Stale coffee | Use fresher beans |
| Poor filtration | Filter more thoroughly |

### Sour/Acidic
| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Under-extracted | Longer steep time |
| Too coarse grind | Grind slightly finer |
| Light roast | Try medium roast |

### Cloudy/Muddy
| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Grind too fine | Much coarser |
| Poor filtration | Double filter (mesh + paper) |
| Fines from grinder | Sift grounds or upgrade grinder |

### Off Flavors
| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Stale taste | Old beans | Fresh coffee (<4 weeks) |
| Cardboard | Oxidation | Better storage |
| Rubbery | Poor quality | Source better beans |

## Kyoto-Style (Slow Drip)

### What is Kyoto Cold Brew?
Japanese slow-drip method using tower drippers that slowly drip ice water over grounds.

### Parameters
| Aspect | Standard |
|--------|----------|
| Time | 3-8 hours |
| Drip rate | 1 drip per 1-2 seconds |
| Grind | Medium-fine |
| Ratio | 1:10-1:12 |

### Characteristics

## Commercial Considerations

### Scaling Up

| Batch Size | Coffee | Water | Steep Time |
|------------|--------|-------|------------|
| Small (1L) | 100g | 800g | 16-20 hours |
| Medium (4L) | 400g | 3.2L | 18-24 hours |
| Large (20L) | 2kg | 16L | 20-24 hours |

### Storage & Shelf Life
- Concentrate: 2 weeks refrigerated
- Ready-to-drink: 7-10 days
- Nitro: 2-3 weeks (kegged)
- Once diluted: 2-3 days

### Cost Considerations
- Uses more coffee per serving than hot brew
- Long shelf life reduces waste
- Premium pricing justified
- Batch efficiency important

## Pro Tips

1. **Bloom first**: Wet grounds with small amount of water, wait 45 seconds, then add rest
2. **Room temp start**: Begin at room temp (4-6 hours) then refrigerate
3. **Paper filter finish**: For crystal-clear cold brew
4. **Pre-chill water**: For faster cooling in fridge
5. **Ice cube cold brew**: Freeze concentrate for cold brew ice cubes
6. **Taste test**: Start checking at 12 hours to find your preference
