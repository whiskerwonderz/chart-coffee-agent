## Kenyan Processing

### Double Fermentation (Standard Kenya Process)

**The key to Kenya's distinctive cup:**

1. **Depulping**: Remove cherry skin
2. **First Fermentation**: 12-24 hours dry
3. **Washing**: Remove loosened mucilage
4. **Second Fermentation**: 12-24 hours underwater
5. **Final Wash**: Clean thoroughly
6. **Soaking**: Extended clean water soak (12-24 hours)
7. **Drying**: Raised beds, 10-21 days

### Why Double Fermentation Matters
- Develops complex acidity
- Creates clean, bright cup
- Enhances fruit characteristics
- Removes all mucilage residue

### Drying Standards
- African raised beds (essential)
- Regular turning (every 30 minutes initially)
- Protection from rain and dew
- Target: 10-12% moisture
