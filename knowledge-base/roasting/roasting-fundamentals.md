# Coffee Roasting Fundamentals

Coffee roasting transforms green coffee beans into the aromatic, flavorful beans ready for brewing through carefully controlled application of heat.

## Overview

### What Happens During Roasting
- Chemical reactions (Maillard, caramelization)
- Physical changes (expansion, color)
- Moisture loss (~12% to ~2%)
- Development of flavor compounds
- CO2 generation

### Key Concepts
- **Endothermic → Exothermic**: Beans absorb then release heat
- **First Crack**: Audible marker of development
- **Second Crack**: Further development stage
- **Development Time**: Time after first crack

## The Roasting Process

### Stages of Roasting

#### 1. Drying Phase (0-4 minutes)
- Beans absorb heat
- Moisture evaporates
- Color: green to yellow
- Grassy smell

#### 2. Yellowing/Browning (4-7 minutes)
- Maillard reactions begin
- Color: yellow to light brown
- Bread-like aroma
- Beans expand slightly

#### 3. First Crack (7-10 minutes)
- Audible popping sound
- Rapid expansion
- Exothermic reaction begins
- Light roast at end of first crack

#### 4. Development (After First Crack)
- Flavor compounds develop
- Roast character builds
- Timing critical here
- Medium roast range

#### 5. Second Crack (Optional)
- Quieter, more rapid cracking
- Oil migration to surface
- Dark roast territory
- Easy to over-roast

### Temperature Milestones

| Stage | Bean Temperature |
|-------|------------------|
| Charge | Room temp beans |
| Turning Point | ~150°C (302°F) |
| Yellowing | ~160°C (320°F) |
| Browning | ~170°C (338°F) |
| First Crack Start | ~196°C (385°F) |
| First Crack End | ~205°C (401°F) |
| Second Crack Start | ~224°C (435°F) |
| Second Crack Rolling | ~230°C+ (446°F+) |

## Key Roasting Variables

### Time

| Variable | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Total roast time | Overall development |
| Development time | Post-first-crack flavor |
| Rate of Rise (RoR) | Smoothness, clarity |

**Development Time Ratio (DTR):**
- Light roast: 15-20% of total time
- Medium: 20-25%
- Dark: 25-30%

### Temperature

| Variable | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Charge temp | Initial momentum |
| Environmental | Heat application rate |
| Bean temp | Actual roast level |
| RoR | Rate of change |

### Airflow

| Setting | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| High airflow | Faster drying, cleaner flavor |
| Low airflow | More body, slower roast |
| Variable | Control throughout roast |

### Drum Speed
- Faster: More even heat, convection
- Slower: More contact heat, conduction

---

## Rate of Rise (RoR)

### What is RoR?
Degrees of temperature change per minute (°C/min or °F/min)

### Typical RoR Patterns

| Phase | Typical RoR |
|-------|-------------|
| Early roast | 15-20°C/min |
| Mid roast | 10-15°C/min |
| First crack | 8-12°C/min |
| Development | 5-10°C/min |

### RoR Guidelines
- **Declining RoR**: Standard approach, smooth development
- **Flat RoR**: Risks baking/stalling
- **Increasing RoR**: Risks scorching

### Flick Prevention
- Avoid RoR spikes after first crack
- Control heat application
- Smooth declining curve ideal

## Developing a Roast Profile

### Steps for Profile Development

1. **Baseline Roast**: Standard approach, note results
2. **Cup Evaluation**: Identify issues or goals
3. **Single Variable Change**: Adjust one thing
4. **Compare**: Side-by-side cupping
5. **Iterate**: Refine until target reached
6. **Document**: Record successful profile

### Variables to Adjust

| Goal | Adjust |
|------|--------|
| More acidity | Lighter roast, shorter development |
| More body | Longer roast, more development |
| More sweetness | Slower RoR, proper development |
| More complexity | Slower roast, extended browning |
| Cleaner cup | Higher airflow, proper development |

## Blending

### Why Blend?
- Consistency across harvests
- Cost optimization
- Flavor complexity
- Espresso balance

### Blending Approaches

**Pre-roast blending:**
- Roast all components together
- Simpler process
- Compromise on individual optimization

**Post-roast blending:**
- Roast components separately
- Optimize each coffee
- More control, more work

### Espresso Blend Principles
- Base (40-60%): Body, sweetness (Brazil, Colombia)
- Mid (20-30%): Complexity, balance
- High note (10-20%): Acidity, aroma (African)
