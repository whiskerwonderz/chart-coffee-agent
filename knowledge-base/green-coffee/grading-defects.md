# Green Coffee Grading & Defects

Green coffee grading is the systematic evaluation of unroasted coffee beans for physical quality. Understanding defects helps assess coffee quality and potential cup impact.

## SCA Green Coffee Classification

The Specialty Coffee Association uses a standardized system for grading Arabica coffee.

### Sample Requirements
- **Sample size**: 350 grams
- **Lighting**: Full spectrum, 4000K, 1200 lux
- **Surface**: Matte black background
- **Time**: 20-30 minutes per sample

### Grade Classifications

| Grade | Defects Allowed | Description |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| Specialty | 0 Cat 1, ≤5 Cat 2 | Highest quality |
| Premium | ≤8 full defects | Good commercial |
| Exchange | ≤23 full defects | Commodity grade |
| Below Standard | 24-86 full defects | Low quality |
| Off Grade | >86 full defects | Reject |

### Specialty Grade Requirements
- Zero Category 1 (primary) defects
- Maximum 5 Category 2 (secondary) defects
- No Quakers allowed in roasted sample
- Must score 80+ points in cupping

---

## Defect Categories

### Category 1 (Primary) Defects
These significantly impact cup quality. ONE defect = disqualification from specialty.

| Defect | Description | Equivalent |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Full Black | Completely black bean | 1 defect |
| Full Sour | Completely sour/fermented | 1 defect |
| Dried Cherry | Whole dried cherry | 1 defect |
| Fungus Damage | Visible mold/fungus | 1 defect |
| Foreign Matter | Non-coffee material | 1 defect |
| Severe Insect | Heavy insect damage | 5 beans = 1 defect |

### Category 2 (Secondary) Defects
Less severe but still undesirable.

| Defect | Description | Equivalent |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Partial Black | Partially black bean | 3 beans = 1 defect |
| Partial Sour | Partially sour | 3 beans = 1 defect |
| Parchment | Parchment attached | 5 beans = 1 defect |
| Floater | Light/hollow bean | 5 beans = 1 defect |
| Immature/Unripe | Undeveloped bean | 5 beans = 1 defect |
| Withered | Shriveled bean | 5 beans = 1 defect |
| Shell | Elephant ear shape | 5 beans = 1 defect |
| Broken/Chipped | Physical damage | 5 beans = 1 defect |
| Hull/Husk | Hull fragment | 5 beans = 1 defect |
| Slight Insect | Minor damage | 10 beans = 1 defect |

## Defect Identification Guide

### Full Black Bean
- **Appearance**: Completely black/dark
- **Cause**: Fermentation, fungus, or over-ripe
- **Cup Impact**: Ferment, off-flavors, dirty
- **Category**: 1

### Full Sour Bean
- **Appearance**: Yellow to brown, shiny
- **Cause**: Over-fermentation
- **Cup Impact**: Vinegar, fermented, unpleasant
- **Category**: 1

### Fungus Damaged
- **Appearance**: Powdery coating, spots
- **Cause**: Mold growth during processing/storage
- **Cup Impact**: Musty, moldy, earthy
- **Category**: 1

### Quaker
- **Appearance**: Pale/under-roasted after roasting
- **Cause**: Unripe cherry, nutrient deficiency
- **Cup Impact**: Papery, cereal, peanutty
- **Note**: Not visible in green, only after roasting

### Insect Damaged
- **Appearance**: Small holes, tunnels
- **Cause**: Coffee borer beetle
- **Cup Impact**: Woody, musty (severe damage)
- **Category**: 1 (severe) or 2 (slight)

### Immature/Unripe
- **Appearance**: Small, pale green, boat-shaped
- **Cause**: Harvested before ripe
- **Cup Impact**: Grassy, astringent, thin
- **Category**: 2

### Broken/Chipped
- **Appearance**: Fractured beans
- **Cause**: Mechanical damage
- **Cup Impact**: Usually minimal if small
- **Category**: 2

### Shell (Elephant Ear)
- **Appearance**: Concave, ear-shaped
- **Cause**: Genetic mutation
- **Cup Impact**: Minimal in small quantities
- **Category**: 2

### Floater
- **Appearance**: Light, sometimes hollow
- **Cause**: Under-developed, drought stress
- **Cup Impact**: Thin, papery
- **Category**: 2

## Screen Size Grading

Coffee beans are sized using screens with round holes measured in 1/64 inch increments.

### Common Screen Sizes

| Screen # | Size (mm) | Grade Name |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| 20 | 8.0 | Very Large |
| 19 | 7.5 | Extra Large |
| 18 | 7.1 | Large (AA) |
| 17 | 6.7 | Bold |
| 16 | 6.3 | Good (AB) |
| 15 | 6.0 | Medium |
| 14 | 5.5 | Small |
| 13 | 5.2 | Peaberry |

### Regional Grading Systems

**Kenya:**
- AA: Screen 18+ (largest)
- AB: Screen 15-16
- PB: Peaberry
- C: Screen 14 and below

**Colombia:**
- Supremo: Screen 17+
- Excelso: Screen 14-16

**Ethiopia:**
- Grade 1: 0-3 defects
- Grade 2: 4-12 defects
- Grade 3: 13-25 defects

**Brazil:**
- Strictly Soft (SS)
- Soft
- Softish
- Hard
- Rioy

## Moisture Content

### Ideal Range
- **Target**: 10-12%
- **Maximum**: 12.5%
- **Minimum**: 9%

### Issues with Moisture

| Level | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| >12.5% | Mold risk, shipping issues |
| <9% | Faded flavor, brittle beans |

### Measuring
- Use calibrated moisture meter
- Take multiple readings
- Store samples properly before testing

---

## Water Activity

Water activity (aw) measures free water available for microbial growth.

### Ideal Range
- **Target**: 0.50-0.60 aw
- **Maximum**: 0.70 aw

### Significance
- Better indicator than moisture alone
- Predicts shelf stability
- Correlates with flavor preservation

---

## Density

### Measurement
- Measured in g/L or g/mL
- Higher density = harder bean
- Typically correlates with altitude

### Density Ranges

| Density | Classification | Typical Altitude |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| >700 g/L | Very High | >1600 masl |
| 650-700 g/L | High | 1200-1600 masl |
| 600-650 g/L | Medium | 800-1200 masl |
| <600 g/L | Low | <800 masl |

### Roasting Implications
- High density = more heat required
- Low density = faster roast development
- Adjust roast profile accordingly

---

## Color Assessment

### Ideal Green Coffee Color
- Blue-green to green-yellow
- Consistent throughout lot
- No fading or bleaching

### Color Issues

| Color | Indicates |
|-------|-----------|
| Pale/whitish | Old coffee, faded |
| Brownish | Age, poor storage |
| Yellow spots | Fermentation damage |
| Dark spots | Mold, insect damage |

---

## Grading Procedure

### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Weigh sample**: 350g exactly
2. **Spread on mat**: Black matte surface
3. **Visual scan**: Overall color, uniformity
4. **Sort defects**: Pick out all defects
5. **Categorize**: Separate Cat 1 and Cat 2
6. **Count**: Tally defect equivalents
7. **Record**: Document all findings
8. **Calculate**: Total defect score

### Documentation
Record for each sample:
- Sample ID and origin
- Screen size distribution
- Defect count by type
- Moisture content
- Color assessment
- Overall grade
- Notes/observations

---

## Storage Recommendations

### Ideal Conditions
- Temperature: 20-25°C (68-77°F)
- Humidity: 50-70% RH
- Away from light
- No odor contamination
- GrainPro or hermetic bags

### Shelf Life
| Storage | Expected Life |
|---------|--------------|
| Jute bags | 6-9 months |
| GrainPro | 12-18 months |
| Vacuum sealed | 18-24 months |
| Frozen | 2+ years |

### Signs of Degradation
- Color fading (baggy appearance)
- Loss of aroma
- Increased moisture
- Visible mold
- Flat, papery cup
